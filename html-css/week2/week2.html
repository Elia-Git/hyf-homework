			<h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h3>
			<P>Examples of dramatic transformation in comminucation and commerece led by web developmnet include e-commerce.Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find nad purchasegoods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com(among many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.</P>

			<h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
			<p>Since the compmericialization of the web,web development has been growing industry. The growth is being driven by bussinesses wishing to use their website to sell products and services to customers.[1]</p>
			<p>There is open source for web development like BerkeleyDB,GlassFish, LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stcks and Perl/Plack. This has kept the const of learning web developmentto a minimum.Another contributing factor to the groeth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSINWYG web-development software,such as Adobe Dreamweaver,BlueGriffon and Microsoft visualStudio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language(HTML) or of programmingg languages is still required to use such software, but the basic can be learned and implemented quickly with the help of files, technical books, internet tutorials, or face-to-face tarinings.</p>
			<p> An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services whice were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These web services allow users to interact with applicationsfrom many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstaion for their application environment.</p>
